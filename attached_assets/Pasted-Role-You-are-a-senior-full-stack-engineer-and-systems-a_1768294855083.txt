Role: You are a senior full-stack engineer and systems architect building a church attendance monitoring platform.

📛 Project Name

CE Attendance System

🏛 Organisation

Church Name: Christ Embassy Abuja Zone 1

Initial Group: Immanent in Wisdom 1 Group

Initial PCF: Prolific PCF

Structure:

Church
 └── Group
      └── PCF
           └── Cell Group
                └── Members

🎯 Core Objective

Build a web-based attendance monitoring system that:

Registers all church members

Organises them by Group → PCF → Cell

Tracks attendance per service

Supports fingerprint attendance (future-ready)

Allows manual and QR-based attendance as fallback

Produces leadership-ready reports

🧱 Tech Stack (use defaults if unspecified)

Backend: Python (FastAPI)

Database: PostgreSQL

ORM: SQLAlchemy

Auth: Role-based access control (RBAC)

Frontend: Simple admin dashboard (HTML + Tailwind or React)

Deployment-ready (env vars, migrations, seed data)

🧩 Core Modules to Build
1. Organisation Setup

Church table (single tenant for now)

Groups

PCFs

Cell Groups

Seed initial data:

Church: Christ Embassy Abuja Zone 1

Group: Immanent in Wisdom 1 Group

PCF: Prolific PCF

2. Member Management

Each member must have:

Full name

Phone number

Gender

Photo (optional)

Unique Member ID (auto-generated)

Group → PCF → Cell assignment

Status (Active / Inactive)

Biometric template field (nullable, for future fingerprint use)

⚠️ Do not store raw fingerprint images.

3. Services

Create a Service entity:

Service name (e.g. Sunday Service, Midweek Service)

Date

Start time

End time

Attendance window

Active flag

4. Attendance System

Attendance records must include:

Member ID

Service ID

Check-in time

Method:

fingerprint

qr_code

manual

Check-in device/location

Prevent duplicate attendance per service

5. Roles & Permissions

Implement RBAC:

Role	Permissions
Admin	Full system access
Group Leader	View group-wide reports
PCF Leader	View PCF + cell attendance
Cell Leader	Manual attendance for own cell
Usher	Attendance check-in only
6. Reporting Dashboard

Build endpoints + basic UI for:

Attendance by service

Attendance by cell

Attendance by PCF

Attendance by group

Absentees per service

Weekly & monthly trends

Focus on clarity, not fancy visuals.

7. Fingerprint Integration (Future-Ready)

Do NOT implement fingerprint hardware now.

Instead:

Create a biometric_template column

Abstract attendance check-in so fingerprint devices can later POST:

member_id
service_id
timestamp
device_id

8. API Requirements

RESTful endpoints

Input validation

Clear error handling

Swagger/OpenAPI documentation enabled

9. Database Requirements

Proper foreign keys

Index attendance queries

Soft deletes where appropriate

Migration support

10. Seed Data

Seed the system with:

Christ Embassy Abuja Zone 1

Immanent in Wisdom 1 Group

Prolific PCF

At least 3 sample cells

10 sample members

🧪 Deliverables

Clean project structure

Well-commented code

README with:

Setup instructions

Roles explanation

How fingerprint can be added later

Sample API calls

🚦Non-goals (Do NOT build now)

Mobile app

Visitor management

Payment or giving

Facial recognition

Multi-church tenancy

⭐ Quality Bar

This system should be:

Scalable

Secure

Easy for non-technical church admins

Ready for biometric expansion without refactor
