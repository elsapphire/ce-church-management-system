Fix the Group Creation flow so that selecting a member and creating a user correctly assigns the Group Pastor and creates the user.

Current bug:
- Admin selects a member as Group Pastor
- Checks “Create user account for this member”
- Group is created BUT:
  - The member is NOT assigned as group pastor
  - The user account is NOT created

Required fixes:

1. Group creation must follow this strict order of operations (single flow):

   a. Validate selectedMember exists
   b. If createUser === true AND selectedMember.isUser === false:
      - Create a new user account FIRST
      - Use:
        - email from selectedMember.email
        - password provided by admin
        - role = "group_pastor"
        - memberId = selectedMember.id
      - Capture the newly created userId

   c. Create the Group using:
      - groupPastorMemberId = selectedMember.id
      - groupPastorUserId = newly created userId (if created)
      - OR existing userId if member was already a user

2. If selectedMember is already a user:
   - Do NOT create a new user
   - Use the existing userId when assigning group pastor

3. Backend must enforce:
   - One user per member (unique constraint on memberId)
   - One group pastor per group

4. Frontend submission logic (Structure.tsx):
   - Must send the following explicitly in the payload:
     - selectedMemberId
     - createUser (boolean)
     - email (only if createUser === true)
     - password (only if createUser === true)
     - role = "group_pastor"

5. Backend API (group creation endpoint):
   - Must NOT assume user already exists
   - Must handle user creation + group creation atomically
   - If user creation fails, group creation must NOT proceed

6. After successful creation:
   - Group hierarchy API must immediately reflect:
     - Assigned group pastor
     - Correct member → user linkage

7. Fix any missing awaits, conditional skips, or early returns causing:
   - User creation to be skipped
   - Group pastor assignment to be lost

8. Ensure:
   - No silent failures
   - Proper error messages returned to frontend if user creation fails
   - App compiles and runs without crashing

Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
Do NOT switch modes.
Fix only the broken group creation logic.
