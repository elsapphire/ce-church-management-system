Problem

The Create Member button does nothing when clicked:

No network request is sent

No UI feedback

No error toast

No console error visible

This started after recent imports + validation changes

Required Debug & Fix Steps (DO NOT SKIP)
1. Frontend: Button & Form Submission

Inspect the Create Member button:

Ensure it is:

Inside a <form>

Has type="submit" OR a valid onClick={handleSubmit}

Verify the submit handler is actually bound

Ensure preventDefault() is not blocking execution incorrectly

2. Frontend: Validation Logic

Audit all frontend validation guards:

Check for early return statements

Especially around:

email

designation

cellId

Confirm:

Email is optional

Empty email is sent as null, not ""

Ensure the submit button is not permanently disabled

Inspect disabled={...} conditions

3. Frontend: Payload Inspection

Before submission:

Log the payload being sent to /api/members

Confirm:

email is either a valid string or null

No undefined values exist

Required fields (firstName, lastName, phone) exist

4. Backend: Route Execution

Inspect POST /api/members:

Add temporary logging to confirm the route is hit

Ensure:

Validation middleware is not rejecting silently

No role-based guard is blocking admin / group pastor

5. Database Constraint Safety

Ensure backend logic:

Converts empty email strings to null

Prevents duplicate empty emails from violating:

members_email_unique

Explicit Fixes to Apply

Normalize email input:

email: email?.trim() || null


Remove any validation that treats email as mandatory

Ensure error responses are surfaced to the UI via toast

Success Criteria

Clicking Create Member:

Sends a POST request

Creates a member even with missing optional fields

Shows success feedback

App does not crash

No silent failures

Important Instruction

❗ Do not refactor unrelated files
❗ Do not introduce new schemas
❗ Fix only what blocks member creation

Expected Outcome

Admins and leaders can:

Create members with partial data

Safely proceed with imports and onboarding

Continue normal CMS operations
